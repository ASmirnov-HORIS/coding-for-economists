# Automating Outputs

In this chapter, you'll learn how to automate the inclusion of figures, tables, and code in your outputs. Much of what you'll see in this chapter is possible in a wide range of languages (not just Python).

## Including code outputs in LaTeX documents

- beamer presentations and papers

- from code in .tex or .pdf into outputs/ folder

- how to pick these up in latex doc

- automate compilation of latex with bash script

## Complete automation of outputs

- outputs can include word docs, pdfs (papers and beamer pres), powerpoint, html slides, html page: anything that pandoc can do. Use codebraid.

- *Many* languages

- two examples, a document and a presentation, both with refs and mention ref doc

- use code_presentation.md and code_pres_md.sh. Run latter with ./code_pres_md.sh
