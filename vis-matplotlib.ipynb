If you read on to the chapter on {ref}`vis-narrative`, you'll see just how flexible it is. **matplotlib** is the foundation stone of quite a few other data visualisation libraries, such as **plotlnine** and **seaborn**, which shows how much it can do!\n",

Apart from being *imperative* rather than *declarative*, it also prefers unstacked data to tidy data: so, to create plots quickly, instead of every line you want to plot being stored in a single column called \"country\" as it would be using tidy data, it prefers *each* column to have a different country in.\n",

Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup.

Each Axes object has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`).

    "Okay, now the quick way to plot this would be to simply call `df.plot()`. That works fine and doesn't look too bad: it recognises that it's dealing with a datetime and plots sensible tick labels on the x-axis, and it produces a legend for each of the two time series. But let's say we want to make that plot quickly *and* do some fine-tuning with **matplotlib**: how can we? The answer is to create a `fig` and an `ax` and then to ask our dataframe to use the `ax` we already created to plot the data. We can then carry on using the `ax` object in any way we like."

    "Quite a few things are happening here. The first is that we asked for more rows and columns from matplotlib using `plt.subplots(nrows, ncolumns)` and instead of returning a single `ax` it returned a list of axes (here of length 2). We then iterated over those axes using enumerate, which gives an integer `i` and an `ax` from the list, and plotted a column on each axis by subsetting the dataframe one column at a time using `df.iloc[:, i]`. Remember that the first position in `iloc` is for the index values (ie the rows), while the second is for the columns. Again, this was quite a lot of code to get a relatively simple chart done! And that's exactly why we're now going to take a look at the declarative library **seaborn** that wraps **matplotlib**."
