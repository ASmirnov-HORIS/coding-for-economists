    "There are actually two ways to use **matplotlib**: the 'pyplot API' and the 'object-oriented API'. The pyplot API (application programming interface) gives an experience that's much closer to the paid programming language Matlab and can be useful to make a quick chart. This is no accident; **matplotlib** originally grew out of a desire to provide plotting functionality that was similar to what was found in Matlab. However, it has subsequently taken on its own style and API, and these developments are now much more powerful and convenient for plotting in Python.\n",

    "The object-oriented API is most often used by creating two objects: the figure and the axes. You should think of the figure object, `fig`, as the canvas on which you can put any number of charts. Each ax (short for 'axis') object is one chart within a figure. Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup. The plotting of elements such as lines, points, bars, and so, are controlled by the `ax` objects while the overall settings are controlled by `fig`.\n",

    "- Figure, or 'fig': the figure keeps track of all the child Axes that are on it and a smattering of 'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc). A figure can contain any number of Axes, but will typically have at least one.\n",
    "- Axes, or 'ax': this is the plot, the region of the image that traces out the data. A given Figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure. The Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (Axes and Axis are different things!) that record the data limits (you can override these via the `axes.Axes.set_xlim()` and `axes.Axes.set_ylim()` methods). Each Axes object has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`). When you add, say, a line chart to an Axes object it appears as a Line2D object associated that that axis and it is created by calling a method on an Axes object.\n",
    "- Axis: these are the number-line objects that control the limits of what the viewer can see. They also provide the means to access the ticks (the marks on the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of Locator and Formatter gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels.\n",

    "You can find a detailed blog post on the ins and outs [here](https://dev.to/skotaro/artist-in-matplotlib---something-i-wanted-to-know-before-spending-tremendous-hours-on-googling-how-tos--31oo). The object-oriented structure of **matplotlib** plots can be confusing at first, but, as we'll see, it pretty much fades into the background when you're making plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **matplotlib** is super-customisable, sometimes achieving what you want directly can be a bit verbose. Let's say we want to now differentiate these points with colour according to which state they belong to and add a legend that says which states have which colour. The easiest way to do this is by creating a for loop."

We then iterated over those axes using enumerate, which gives an integer `i` and an `ax` from the list, and plotted a column on each axis by subsetting the dataframe one column at a time using `df.iloc[:, i]`. Remember that the first position in `iloc` is for the index values (ie the rows), while the second is for the columns. Again, this was quite a lot of code to get a relatively simple chart done!
