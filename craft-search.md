# Putting the Search in Research

This chapter has tips for engaging with the vast amount of economic literature out there.

## Searching and connecting the literature

### General Tips for using Search Engines

Let's start with the basics: how to write good queries for search engines. You don't need to remember much from this section to improve your ability to filter search results to what you're actually looking for. While these tips are written with Google in mind, many of them will work with other good search engines.

Tips:

- Quotes. Put quotes around search terms to let you search exactly for that word or set of words: all results will have those terms in it. Example: "Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium".
- Dashes, '-'. Use these to exclude words from your search. Example: 'fruit -oranges'.
- Tilde, '~'. Use tilde when you want synonyms to appear in the result. Example: 'time series ~courses' to get lessons and other variations on 'courses'.
- Search a single site using 'site:<url>'. This is an especially useful one. Example 'site:https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists regression'.
- Vertical bar, '|'. Acts like the 'or' operator. Example: 'forecasting | nowcasting'.
- Two Periods, '..'. This creates a range from the number before to the number after. Example: 'recessions 1986..2010'.
- Location, 'location:'. Find results related to a particular location. Example: 'recessions location:unitedkingdom'.
- File type, 'filetype:'. This looks for files of a specific type. Example: 'synthetic differences in differences filetype:pdf'.

### Google Scholar

Of course, vanilla search comes up with many irrelevant links if you're looking for research. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/) solves this problem by only returning papers and working papers. It indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines---so you can find pretty much any research that's out there digitally. (The flip side of this is that if your institution's research is not indexed by Google Scholar, it's close to unfindable online.) *Google Scholar is the most important free search engine for scholarly works.*

You can use the same tricks for Google Scholar queries that apply for Google's main search engine. 

Scholar has a few extras useful for the papers that you find:

- a cite button, which includes a bibtex version of the citation
- a list of papers that have cited the paper you're interested in
- a button to find related articles

There are two other ways that Google Scholar can be a useful asset: *alerts* and *recommendations*.

You can set up *alerts* to email you when a particular query receives new results or when there is new work by a specific author. You'll need a profile to do this. It can be a useful way to stay abreast of new work on a topic that you're interested in.

Two alerts come by default, *recommended articles* and *new articles in my profile*. The latter covers papers that Google Scholar thinks you authored. The former recommends papers depending the topics of your articles, the journals that you publish in, the authors you work with and cite, and the authors that work in the same topics as you.

### Semantic Scholar

Google Scholar isn't the only free scholarly search engine in town.[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) provides free, AI-driven search and discovery tools, and open resources for the global research community. It indexes over 200 million academic papers sourced from publisher partnerships, data providers, and web crawls. Note that Semantic Scholar makes use of a publicly available corpus.

Semantic Scholar also comes with useful extras:

- a cite button, which includes a bibtex version of the citation
- a list of papers that have cited the paper you're interested in
- a way to find related articles (click through to the paper)
- a list of papers that are referenced in the paper of interest

### Connected Papers

[Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) is a paid service that displays network diagrams of papers that are connected by citations (inward or outward). With a free account, you can make a small number of graphs per month.

### The RePEc Family of Resources

First, RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is an initiative that seeks to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related areas. It's another scholarly database, with various services built on top.

#### EconPapers and IDEAS

[EconPapers](https://econpapers.repec.org/) and [IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/) include everything that is indexed in RePEc and have extensive search and browsing functions.

#### NEP, or New Economics Papers

[NEP](http://nep.repec.org/) is a collection of topical mailing lists and RSS feeds for new working papers. You can find a full list of both the email subscriptions and RSS feeds [here](https://ideas.repec.org/n/).

#### RePEc Biblio

[RePEc Biblio](https://biblio.repec.org/alltopics.html) is a hand-selected collection of the most relevant articles and papers on a wide variety of economics topics. RePEc Biblio is organised as a tree, narrowing the topics as you follow its branches. If search is about finding a needle in a haystack, RePEc Biblio gives you a way to search smaller haystacks. It's a curated bibliography driven by volunteer editors that, unlike Wikipedia, has a named person in charge of each topic.

### Consensus

[Consensus](https://consensus.app/) is a (free for now, it's in beta) search engine that uses AI to instantly extract, aggregate, and distill findings directly from scientific research. It's early days, but it's shaping up to be a very powerful tool.

You use Consensus by asking a question, for example "what are the main effects of micro credit?". What [you get](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20are%20the%20main%20effects%20of%20micro%20credit) are lines and paragraphs drawn from papers that get at the given question. We've been quite impressed by the results.

### Scite

[Scite](https://www.scite.ai/home) is a paid service that pulls related citations and the context in which the paper was cited. It then sorts those citations of the paper you're interested in based on whether the context was just a mention, an expression of support, and or a contrasting statement.

### Talk to Books

Not everything you need is in journal articles! Google provides a service called [Talk to Books](https://books.google.com/talktobooks/) that allows you to ask questions of books and get reasonable-ish answers. But, if you use this, do remember to use the filters to remove fiction!
