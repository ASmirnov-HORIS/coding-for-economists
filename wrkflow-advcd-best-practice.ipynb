    "\n",
    "Computers are *very* literal, so literal that unless you're perfectly precise about what you want, they will end up doing something different. When that happens, one of the most difficult issues in programming is to understand *why* the code isn't doing what you expected. When the code doesn't do what we expect, it's called a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs could be fundamental issues with the code you're using (in fact, the term originated because a moth causing a problem in an early computer) and, if you find one of these, you should file an issue with the maintainers of the code. However, what's much more likely is that the instructions you gave aren't quite what is needed to produce the outcome that you want. And, in this case, you might need to *debug* the code: to find out which part of it isn't doing what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a small code base, it can be tricky to track down where the bug is: but don't fear, there are tools on hand to help you find where the bug is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest, and I'm afraid to say the most common, way to debug code is to plonk `print` statements in the code. Let's take a common example in which we perform some simple array operations, here multiplying an array and then summing it with another array:"

Well, they seem to have quote marks around them and what that means is that they're strings, *not* floating point numbers or integers! Multiplying a string by 1.5 doesn't make sense here, so that's our error. If we did this, we might then trace the origin of that array back to find out where it was defined and see that instead of `np.array([3, 2, 5, 16, 7, 8, 9, 22])` being declared, we have `np.array([3, 2, 5, 16, '7', 8, 9, 22])` instead and `numpy` decides to cast the whole array as a string to ensure consistency.\n",
