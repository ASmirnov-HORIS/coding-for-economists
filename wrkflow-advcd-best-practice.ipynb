    "\n",
    "Computers are *very* literal, so literal that unless you're perfectly precise about what you want, they will end up doing something different. When that happens, one of the most difficult issues in programming is to understand *why* the code isn't doing what you expected. When the code doesn't do what we expect, it's called a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs could be fundamental issues with the code you're using (in fact, the term originated because a moth causing a problem in an early computer) and, if you find one of these, you should file an issue with the maintainers of the code. However, what's much more likely is that the instructions you gave aren't quite what is needed to produce the outcome that you want. And, in this case, you might need to *debug* the code: to find out which part of it isn't doing what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a small code base, it can be tricky to track down where the bug is: but don't fear, there are tools on hand to help you find where the bug is.\n",

    "### Print statements\n",

    "The simplest, and I'm afraid to say the most common, way to debug code is to plonk `print` statements in the code. Let's take a common example in which we perform some simple array operations, here multiplying an array and then summing it with another array:"

    "\n",
    "To begin debugging using Visual Studio Code, get a script ready, for example `script.py`, that you'd like to debug. If your script has an error in, a debug run will automatically run into it and stop on the error; alternatively you can click to the left of the line number in your script to create a *breakpoint* that your code will stop at anyway when in debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin a debug session, click on the play button partially covered by a bug that's on the left hand ribbon of the VS Code window. It will bring up a menu. Click 'Run and debug' and select 'Python file'. The debugger will now start running the script you had open. When it reaches and error or a breakpoint it will stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? Once the code stops, you can hover over any variables and see what's 'inside' them, which is useful for working out what's going on. Remember, in the examples above, we only saw variables that we asked for. Using the debugger, we can hover over any variable we're interested in without having to decide ahead of time! We can also see other useful bits of info such as the *call stack* of functions that have been called, what local (within the current scope) and global (available everywhere) variables have been defined, and we can nominate variables to watch too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you now want to progress the code on from a breakpoint; you can do this too. You'll see that a menu has appeared with stop, restart, play, and other buttons on it. To skip over the next line of code, use the curved arrow over the dot. To dig in to the next line of code, for example if it's a function, use the arrow pointing toward a dot. To carry on running the code, use the play button.\n",
