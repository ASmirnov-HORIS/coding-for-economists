    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of geospatial analysis with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be aware when following this chapter that installing geographic analysis packages isn't always the easiest and things can and do go wrong! (Some geospatial analysis courses recommend running everything in a Docker container.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of spatial data geographic information systems (GIS): vector and raster. Vector spatial data are made up of vertices and paths. These are represented computationally by points (zero-dimensional objects, if you like), lines (1D objects), and polygons (2D objects, aka an area). Vector data are analogous to vector image formats, like .eps and .pdf, they are smooth and well-defined regardless of the level of zoom you look at them (on a map). Raster data are composed of pixels, also known as grid cells. Each cell has a different value and the raster map is overlaid on a map. Raster data are better for continuous variables such as temperature or rainfall, while vector data are better suited to political boundaries and features like roads. In this book, we'll only cover vector geospatial data analysis (if you need to work with rasters, check out [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common file formats for vector data include Shapefile (.shp...), GeoJSON/JSON, KML and GeoPackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate Reference Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) associates numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth. Latitude and longitude are an example (and have units of degrees) but there are many CRSs. They are important because they define how your data will look on a map. Think about it like this: in the case of the usual charts you plot, you usually take it as given that you are working in a space that is 2D with an X- and Y-basis vector. But the most basic object in mapping is a *sphere*, which is fundamentally different to a 2D plane. This means you have to choose whether to show part of a globe or all of a 2D representation of a globe (a *projection*), which inevitably introduces distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type main classes of CRS are geographic or projection. A geographic CRS uses a 3D model of the Earth and 'drapes' the data over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A projected CRS has the geographic CRS plus a map projection that has co-ordinates on a 2D plane. It is well known that there is no distortion-free projection from a globe to a plane; you cannot preserve areas, shapes, distances, and angles simultaneously. Different map projections introduce different distortions, as lovingly shown in this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/977/) cartoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of a map projection is the Mercator projection, which is a *conformal mapping*, i.e. a mapping that locally preserves angles, but not necessarily lengths. In fact, Mercator distorts areas, especially the further away an area is from the equator. Some projections are better for some purposes than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "![XKCD Bad Map Projection: South America](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/bad_map_projection_south_america.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "XKCD: Bad Map Projection: South America\n",
    "\n",
    "Some analysis tools expect geospatial data to be in a projected CRS-this is true of the main package we'll use, **geopandas**. This is usually not a problem for economic data; it's rare that the curvature of the Earth becomes a factor (though distances might in some rare situations). Most spatial libraries expect that all of the data that are being combined be in the same CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRSs are usually referenced by an [EPSG code](https://epsg.io/). Two widely used CRSs are WGS84 (aka EPSG: 4326) which provides a good representaiton of most places on Earth and NAD83 (aka EPSG: 4269), which provides a good representation of the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we banging on about this? Because maps and geometry objects come in different CRS and it's worth being aware of that so that you can ensure they are in the same format, and that you have the right CRS for your purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using [**geopandas**](https://geopandas.org/index.html), the go-to package for vector spatial analysis in Python. The easiest way to install this package is using `conda install geopandas`; if you want to install it via pip then look at the [install instructions](https://geopandas.org/install.html). \n",
