    "# Forecasting Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we're going to do a tour of forecasting *environments*: that is, the set of slices of time that you might need to put together when doing any forecast exercise. There won't be too much code in this chapter: we're just laying the theoretical groundwork here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some definitions. Features, or regressors, are labelled by $k = 0, \\dots, K-1$ and time by $t = 0, \\dots, T-1$. Note that this means there are $T$ time periods and $K$ features. We'll label different slices of time by an index $\\mu$ beginning from $\\mu=1$, and we'll give these slices of time different labels: IS for in-sample and OS for out-of-sample. The target variable (the number we are trying to forecast) is $\\left\\{y_{t+h}\\right\\}_{t=0}^{t=T-1}$, where $h$ is the number of time steps ahead we wish to forecast. Let $\\left\\{x_{tk}\\right\\}_{t=0}^{t=T-1}$ represent feature (or regressor) $k$. This is a bit simplistic because of real-time data timeliness, but in general a forecast implies $h>0$ (otherwise we're doing a nowcast).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Period Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple forecast you can imagine is if we have two periods (each of which may be made up of more than one value of $t$). The important thing is that the $t$ in the first, \"in-sample\" period do not overlap with the $t$ in the second, \"out-of-sample\" period. That's because we *only want to use information in the in-sample period to forecast the out-of-sample period*. There are some cases where you may want to \"forecast\" the in-sample period, but if you're interested in the real-world performance of your forecast, this is the setup you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this world of a single in-sample period and a single out-of-sample period, $\\mu=1$, and we could get drop that notation and just use IS and OS. But we'll leave it in to make the contrast with what's to come clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is to use a model, $f$, that is trained to predict $\\{y_{t+h}, t:\\mu_{\\text{IS}}=1\\}$ using $\\{x_{tk}, t:\\mu_{\\text{IS}}=1\\}$ to forecast $\\{y_{t+h}, t:\\mu_\\text{OS}=1\\}$ using $\\{x_{tk}, t:\\mu_{\\text{OS}}=1\\}$. It's actually easier to see it with a picture:"
