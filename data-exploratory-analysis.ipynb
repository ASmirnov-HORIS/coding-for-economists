    "There are some things we should do even before an exploratory data analysis; we should make sure we've cast the columns to the right types and converted any that need converting. Even a quick look at the data provided by `.head()` shows that the `Date` column is in a weird format, the number of `Baths` is a floating point number rather than an integer (is it possible to have half a bathroom? Maybe, but it doesn't sound very private), and there are some NaNs in there too. It's not clear what the fractional values of bathrooms mean (including from the documentation) so we'll just have to take care with that variable.\n",

The documents also tell us that the final year is 2015. We'd really like to have a more usable datetime column than this so let's sort this out first. Ideally, we'd like to *map* the `Date` column into a new `datetime` column that turns 16436 into 1st Jan 2005, 16437 into 2nd Jan 2005, and so on, until we have a mapping for every date between the first date in the dataset and the last. \n",

We'll determine the number of periods from the maximum value of the `Date` column (which is the last date represented) minus the start counter, which we know is 16436. To create a mapping from the coded numbers to the dates, we'll use the `zip` function, which pairs two sets of numbers together, and the `dict` function so that we get key, value pairs that we can conveniently feed into a dataframe.\n",

Rendered in snake case, it would be 'this_is_a_col_name', which is longer but slightly easier to read. So we should really change the column names to be in snake case.

There isn't much difference between them in general apart from it seems like **dataprep** has slightly better support for string column types (check out the details of `Address` below) and is a little bit richer on visualisations (it has interactive plots that you can change the axes of-look at the interactions page below).\n",

You should know now how to do simple analysis of **pandas** dataframes using techniques from other chapters to create summary statistics, using styling of tables of summary statistics, and using the quick visualisation options that are built-in to **pandas**. You should also know where to go for more in-depth, heavy duty exploratory data analysis reports, namely **pandas-profiling** and **dataprep**."
